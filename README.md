## Directory and File Descriptions

- **`.git/`**: This hidden directory is used by Git for version control. It contains all the necessary metadata for the repository, including configuration files, branches, and commit history.

- **`Classification_validation/`**: This directory contains the code and results for classification tasks. It includes scripts for training classification models, evaluating their performance, and storing the output of the classification processes.

- **`discover-eeg-master/`**: This directory is likely a cloned or downloaded version of the DISCOVER-EEG project, which includes code for processing and analyzing EEG data. It may contain scripts, data files, and documentation related to EEG analysis.

- **`Figure/`**: This directory holds the scripts for visualizing the dataset's basic information and the classification results. The visualizations are crucial for understanding the data characteristics and the performance of the classification models.

- **`PSD`**: This is a program file responsible for extracting Power Spectral Density (PSD) features from the EEG data. PSD features are important for analyzing the frequency domain characteristics of the EEG signals.
